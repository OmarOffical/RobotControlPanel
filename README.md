# RobotControlPanel
This is My Robot Control Panel I did Two Html Files one For The Robot arm Engines and the other for base control 
I added a button that allows the user to switch between the two controllers by pressing it. If you control the arm and want to control the base, you can press it and it will take you to the other control page
I also added my ibm Watson assistant
